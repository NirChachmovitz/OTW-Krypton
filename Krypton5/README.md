# Krypton5 - Walkthrough

## Instruction
Frequency analysis can break a known key length as well.  Lets try one
last polyalphabetic cipher, but this time the key length is unknown.


Enjoy.

## Solution

Let's find a probable key with our favorite dcodr.fr site,
and now try for each key length.

We found for length = 9 the key KEYLENGTH (how unique),

and the plaintext is RANDOM.

TADA!
